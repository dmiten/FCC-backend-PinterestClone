## Build a Pinterest Clone
<b><i>Objective:</i></b> Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to 
[this]( https://midnight-dust.hyperdev.space).
 Then deploy it to Glitch.<br>
Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Glitch 
project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit 
[this](https://freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-dynamic-web-application-projects).<br>
<br>
Here are the specific <b><i>user stories</i></b> you should implement for this project:
<br>
 - As an unauthenticated user, I can login with Twitter.
 - As an authenticated user, I can link to images.
 - As an authenticated user, I can delete images that I've linked to.
 - As an authenticated user, I can see a Pinterest-style wall of all the images I've linked to.
 - As an unauthenticated user, I can browse other users' walls of images.
 -  As an authenticated user, if I upload an image that is broken, it will be replaced by a placeholder image. (can use jQuery broken image detection).
